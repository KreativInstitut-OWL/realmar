## Install

```bash
npm install
```

For some reason the `canvas` package tries to build from source. When you see a lot of errors when running npm install, that is what going on. See [node-canvas > Installation > Compiling](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more information on how to fix this.
